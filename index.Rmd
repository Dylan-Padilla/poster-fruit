We are offering the opportunity for outstanding students to get involved in research projects starting in `r colorize("Fall 2023 or Spring 2024", "orange")`. `r emo::ji("science")``r emo::ji("scientist")`

<br>

Our lab examines the evolution of foraging behavior and the life history of fruit flies. Specifically, we analyze the frequency of alleles with underlying effects on the foraging behavior of individuals evolving under different `r colorize("selective pressures", "orange")` in the laboratory, which enables one to make strong inferences concerning `r colorize("phenotypic and genetic", "orange")` responses to `r colorize("selection", "orange")`.

<br>

The main roles of students will include:

- Maintenance of populations of fruit flies in the laboratory. `r emo::ji("bug")`

- Design of experimental studies followed by the application of statistical analyses. `r emo::ji("stats")` `r icons::fontawesome("r-project")`

- Data gathering of energy acquisition in larvae. `r emo::ji("computer")`

This offer includes a salary that will be determined by an agreement between students and the lab PI. If you are interested in working with us, please feel free to reach out at dpadil10@asu.edu `r emo::ji("email")`
